# `olefile` for ImageJ / Jython :coffee: :snake: :microscope:

A mavenized package of [Philippe Lagadec][gh_decalage2]'s
[`olefile`][gh_olefile] Python module to be used in [ImageJ][imagej].

## Packaging

The `pom.xml` is inspired by the [imagej-jython-package][gh_ij_jy] repository
from [Michael Entrup][gh_m-entrup] with adaptations to make it work with the
original structure of the upstream `olefile` package.
